# Progress Log
<!-- 
  WHAT: Your session log - a chronological record of what you did, when, and what happened.
  WHY: Answers "What have I done?" in the 5-Question Reboot Test. Helps you resume after breaks.
  WHEN: Update after completing each phase or encountering errors. More detailed than task_plan.md.
-->

## Session: 2026-01-21
<!-- 
  WHAT: The date of this work session.
  WHY: Helps track when work happened, useful for resuming after time gaps.
  EXAMPLE: 2026-01-15
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
<!-- 
  WHAT: Detailed log of actions taken during this phase.
  WHY: Provides context for what was done, making it easier to resume or debug.
  WHEN: Update as you work through the phase, or at least when you complete it.
-->
- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-01-21 00:00
<!-- 
  STATUS: Same as task_plan.md (pending, in_progress, complete)
  TIMESTAMP: When you started this phase (e.g., "2026-01-15 10:00")
-->
- Actions taken:
  <!-- 
    WHAT: List of specific actions you performed.
    EXAMPLE:
      - Created todo.py with basic structure
      - Implemented add functionality
      - Fixed FileNotFoundError
  -->
  - Initialized planning files from skill templates.
  - Attempted session-catchup script; logged missing CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT.
  - Reviewed repo structure and placeholders; captured requirements.
  - Confirmed cache location, repo update strategy, and naming scheme with user.
- Files created/modified:
  <!-- 
    WHAT: Which files you created or changed.
    WHY: Quick reference for what was touched. Helps with debugging and review.
    EXAMPLE:
      - todo.py (created)
      - todos.json (created by app)
      - task_plan.md (updated)
  -->
  - task_plan.md (created)
  - findings.md (created)
  - progress.md (created)

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
- **Status:** in_progress
- Actions taken:
  - Recorded decision to use Pydantic v2 for configuration.
  - Logged new requirement: SaaS mode via env vars as primary path.
  - Captured SaaS API v1 contract (skills list + file fetch + auth).
- Files created/modified:
  -

### Phase 2: [Title]
<!-- 
  WHAT: Same structure as Phase 1, for the next phase.
  WHY: Keep a separate log entry for each phase to track progress clearly.
-->
- **Status:** pending
- Actions taken:
  -
- Files created/modified:

## Test Results
<!-- 
  WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened.
  WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions.
  WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification).
  EXAMPLE:
    | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ |
    | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ |
-->
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
|      |       |          |        |        |

## Error Log
<!-- 
  WHAT: Detailed log of every error encountered, with timestamps and resolution attempts.
  WHY: More detailed than task_plan.md's error table. Helps you learn from mistakes.
  WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly.
  EXAMPLE:
    | 2026-01-15 10:35 | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Added file existence check |
    | 2026-01-15 10:37 | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Added empty file handling |
-->
<!-- Keep ALL errors - they help avoid repetition -->
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-01-21 00:00 | session-catchup.py not found (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT unset) | 1 | Used explicit template path; proceed without catchup |
| 2026-01-21 00:10 | poetry install permission denied (virtualenv lock) | 1 | Pending: need user direction |
| 2026-01-21 00:11 | pytest not found | 1 | Pending: need user direction |
| 2026-01-21 00:13 | poetry install failed (python requires <4.0 for openapi-pydantic) | 1 | Pending: update pyproject or skip deps |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
<!-- 
  WHAT: Five questions that verify your context is solid. If you can answer these, you're on track.
  WHY: This is the "reboot test" - if you can answer all 5, you can resume work effectively.
  WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset.
  
  THE 5 QUESTIONS:
  1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md
  2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases
  3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md
  4. What have I learned? → See findings.md
  5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file)
-->
<!-- If you can answer these, context is solid -->
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 1 (Requirements & Discovery) |
| Where am I going? | Phases 2-5 in task_plan.md |
| What's the goal? | Implement yourskill-mcp stdio MCP server with CLI + skill loading |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | See above |

<!-- 
  REMINDER: 
  - Update after completing each phase or encountering errors
  - Be detailed - this is your "what happened" log
  - Include timestamps for errors to track when issues occurred
-->
*Update after completing each phase or encountering errors*
- Logged new requirement: SaaS mode via env vars (conflicts with original constraints).
- Recorded merge rule: local skills override SaaS when both present.
- Recorded scheme decision: use skill:// for all resources.
